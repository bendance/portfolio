So, what should be on my portfolio?

Let's look at other portfolios:

There should be five sections:
- Home
- About
- Skills
- Works
- Connect

Home contains:
hero image (I need to get some pictures taken)
and text saying hello I'm ben dance
Links to Github, Linkedin, and Twitter

About:
- Just some stuff about me

Skills:
- Write a bit about your Skills

- Works:
Spotify API project. Game project. Graphic Design work. Just look at what you've been doing.

- Connect:
Create a form where people who use the form can send you emails

Known bugs:
- When scrolling the section that I'm on doesn't change highlight of nav text
- Social icons are still orange
