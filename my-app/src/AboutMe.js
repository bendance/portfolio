            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Benjamin Dance and I am an entry level full-stack developer and a native of Indianapolis, Indiana.
            I am about to graduate from Indiana University Bloomington in Spring of 2022 with a double major in Computer Science
            and Interactive and Digital Media. Throughout my time in university, I've been an active member of the Code@IU club and
            have even won their 2021 Hackathon. This is not as impressive as it sounds because I was the only person who participated.</p>
            <p>In my freetime, I like helping my friends with various projects they're working on and I enjoy working on my own projects.
            The project that I'm most proud of is a Spotify Playlist generator which scrapes the top 100 most popular songs in a genre and
            compiles them into a Spotify playlist.</p>
